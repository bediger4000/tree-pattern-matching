INTRODUCTION

An implementation of:
Hoffman, C. and O'Donnel, J., "Pattern matching in trees", JACM, 29(1), 68–95, 1982.

Which in turn uses Aho/Corasick multiple string matching:
Aho, Alfred V.; Margaret J. Corasick (June 1975).
"Efficient string matching: An aid to bibliographic search".
Communications of the ACM 18 (6): 333–340. 

Implemented in ANSI C89, I believe.

Trees represented as lisp-style 2-element lists.  Must be fully parenthesized.

(a b)
(one (two three))
((one two) (three four))

Pattern lists can contain '*' characters which represent "match anything",
globbing-style wildcards.  A '*' matches any subtree, or any leaf.


BUILDING

tar xf whatever.tar
cd tree_match0
make
sh ./test.input

Uses gcc as C compiler, but Clang and pcc also work.
